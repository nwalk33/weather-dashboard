## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is a weather dashboard application that allows users to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. The application retrieves weather data from the 5 Day Weather Forecast API provided by OpenWeatherMap.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The weather dashboard allows you to search for a city through the search bar and view
current weather conditions. The application displays the city name, date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the selected city. It also presents a 5-day forecast of the same statistics for the next 5 days. When a city is searched, it is added to the search history section. Clicking on a city in the search history will display the current and future conditions for that city again.
